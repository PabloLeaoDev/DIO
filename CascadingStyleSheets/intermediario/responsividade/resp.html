        I feel ashamed,
        With abandon in my heart and on my face
        I've suffered the blame,
        I would show to you this way but I'm too late
        When the sorrow it breaks them,
        I will replace them
        For you.
        Dead flowers for the torn apart.
        Laid at the grave to heal a broken heart.
        Let it rain until it floods
        Let the sun breathe life once more
        Reborn.
        I wish you the same
        To walk beside and carry on this flame.
        To see you again
        With a radiance of pure and holiness.
        When the sorrow it breaks them,
        I will replace them
        For you.
        Dead flowers for the torn apart.
        Laid at the grave to heal a broken heart.
        Let it rain until it floods
        Let the sun breathe life once more
        Reborn.
        Dead flowers for the torn apart.
        Laid at the grave to heal a broken heart.
        Let it rain until it floods
        Let the sun breathe life once more
        Reborn.
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
        Dead flowers for the torn apart.
        Let it rain until it floods
        Let the sun breathe life once more
        Reborn.
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
        Dead flowers for the torn apart
